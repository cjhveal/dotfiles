This repository contains my personal configurations.

### TODO

* information on how to install this repo
* bootstrap script (set shell to zsh, etc)
* zsh completions and learn about zsh functions
* automatically detect and configure rbenv/rvm
* find a way to add lowercase weekday to prompt
* get rails commands to check if in a rails project
* set up pry as default rails console (rc should use pry if possible)
* default packages list (brews/gems)
* what else can go into my gitconfig? more coloring?
* why are l9, vim-fuzzyfinder and zoomwin making docs/tags?
* fix vim colorscheme (modified solarize? tomorrow-night?)
